abstract: >-
  Ethnic diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa is often considered a detriment to economic development, hindering economic growth and spurring conflict. However, the empirical evidence on the latter is limited and based on a narrow set of measures. In this paper, I investigate how diversity in historical narratives between groups affects a wide range of conflict events. I find that both the similarity of narratives across groups, as well as the specific content of narratives, mediate the diversity-conflict relationship. I show that more distinct narratives relate to stronger in-group identification
