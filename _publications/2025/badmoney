abstract: >-
  Witchcraft beliefs, common in African societies, shape attitudes toward income and inequality. A lab experiment in Nairobi reveals divergent views: some see income from occult practices as undeserved and redistribute or destroy it, while others view it as legitimate business investment. These findings inform understanding of inequality and redistribution demands.
