abstract: >-
  Fairness perceptions are important for policy-making and social cohesion. In a series of lab experiments conducted in Nairobi, we contrast the fairness views of university participants and those from an informal settlement. We find a plurality of fairness ideals, including those favoring luck over effort and strong misperceptions about the 'poor'. Such misperceptions may lead to misguided policies.
