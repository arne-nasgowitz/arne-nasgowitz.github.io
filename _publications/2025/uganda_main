abstract: >-
  A childcare subsidy increased single mothers' labor supply and earnings while boosting fathers' salaried employment in couples. At the household level, childcare raised income, and consumption, and improved child development. Cash grants similarly enhanced mothers' labor supply and income, highlighting the role of credit constraints in womenâ€™s economic opportunities.
