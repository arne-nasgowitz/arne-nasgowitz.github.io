    My name is Arne Nasgowitz, and I am a Researcher at the Center for Applied Research (SNF) at the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen. 
    I completed my PhD at the Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality (FAIR) and the Department of Economics

    I'm a development economist and my research mainly focuses on education, labor markets, female empowerment, time poverty, narratives and norms.
