    My name is Arne Nasgowitz and I am a Researcher at the Center for Applied Research (<a href="https://www.snf.no/">SNF</a>) at the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen. 
    I completed my PhD at the Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality (<a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/">FAIR</a>) and the Department of Economics 
    at NHH. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a development economist and my research mainly focuses on education, ranging from early childhood development to the transition into the labor market. I am also interested in the role of supernatural beliefs and norms.
